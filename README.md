# Java-Programs
This repository contains all of my first year JAVA programs that were required as material for my programming modules (in both semesters).
<br><br><br>
Contains only JAVA files, not compiled.<br>
Goes from real basic JAVA (writing hello world) to more complex tasks (modelling data structures such as trees and DGA).
